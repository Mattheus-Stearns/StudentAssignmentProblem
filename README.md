# StudentAssignmentProblem

Do YOU have a problem on your hands? 35 Projects and 385 Students who want to apply to those projects but YOU dont know where to start? First, make a google form, asking for their student email, their first, second and third choice for what project they want, and dont forget the project that they don't want. Then, export that google form as a csv, and rename it as "student_sample.csv". Then, open "project_capacities.csv", and add the individual capacities for each project. You can replace the sample data in the files, but just remember to keep everyithing case sensitive and in the same column. Save "project_capacities.csv" in the same folder that you have "student_samples.csv". Then, download "student_project_assignment_problem.py" in that same folder, and run it. Vo√≠la! All that pesky work done! (Keep in mind that if you have more than a hundred students it might take more than a millisecond to load. ;)
